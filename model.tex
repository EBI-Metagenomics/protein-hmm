\section{Model}

\begin{definition}\label{def:mp}
  A Markov process is a stochastic process $Q_1, \dots$ for which
  \begin{align*}
    p(Q_t=q_t \gv Q_1=q_1, Q_2=q_2, \dots, Q_{t-1}=q_{t-1}) = p(Q_t=q_t \gv Q_{t-1}=q_{t-1}).
  \end{align*}
  The possible values of $Q_t$ form a finite set $\set{Q}$ called the state space.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}\label{def:hmm}
  Let $\set{A}$ be a non-empty finite set of symbols. Let $Q_1, Q_2, \dots$ be a Markov process and
  let $S_1, S_2, \dots$ be a stochastic process for which
  \begin{align*}
    p(S_t\in\set{A} \gv Q_1=q_1, Q_2=q_2, \dots, Q_t=q_t) = p(S_t\in\set{A} \gv Q_t=q_t).
  \end{align*}
  The pair $(Q_t, S_t)$ is a hidden Markov model (HMM) with alphabet $\set{A}$.
\end{definition}

The standard HMM definition is often extended to include states that do not emit symbols. Those
states are referred to as silent states and are useful to describe a missing alignment position, for
example. This section goes a step further by defining a more general hidden Markov model that
accounts for states that instead emit sequence of symbols of variable length, including zero-length
sequences.

\begin{definition}
  Let $\set{A}$ be a non-empty finite set of symbols, $k\in\field{N}_0$, and define
  $\set{B}=\bigcup_{i=0}^k\set{A}^i$.
  Let $Q_1, Q_2, \dots$ be a Markov process and let $S_1, S_2, \dots$ be a stochastic process for
  which
  \begin{equation*}
    p(S_t\in\set{B} \gv Q_1=q_1, Q_2=q_2, \dots, Q_t=q_t)
    = p(S_t\in\set{B} \gv Q_t=q_t).
  \end{equation*}
  The pair $(Q_t, S_t)$ is an invisible Markov model (IMM) with alphabet $\set{A}$ and
  limit $k$.
\end{definition}

Let $\arr{z}=z_1 .. z_L$ be a sequence emitted from an IMM.
The marginal likelihood of $\arr{s}$ is given by
\begin{align}\label{eq:ml}
  \mathrm{ML}(\arr{z}) = p(V_1=\arr{z}) + p(V_1\neq\arr{z}, V_1||V_2=\arr{z}) +
  p(V_1\neq\arr{z}, V_1||V_2\neq\arr{z}, V_1||V_2||V_3=\arr{z}) + \dots,
\end{align}
where $||$ denotes sequence concatenation.

Let $F_t$ be the sequence length emitted by $S_t$, $L_t = 0+F_1+\dots+F_{t-1}$,
and $V_{1..t} = V_1||V_2||\dots||V_t$.
We have
\begin{align*}
  p(V_{1..1} \neq \arr{z}, V_{1..2} \neq \arr{z}, \dots, V_{1..{t-1}} \neq \arr{z}, V_{1..t}=\arr{z})
  = p(V_{1..t}=\arr{z}, L_t<L).
\end{align*}
Therefore, the marginal likelihood is also given by
\begin{align*}
  \mathrm{ML}(\arr{z}) = \sum_{t=1}^{\infty} p(V_{1..t}=\arr{z}, L_t<L).
\end{align*}

\subsection{Discussion}

For computational reasons, it would be useful to have an upper bound on the summation of the
marginal likelihood.
We will define a type of IMM that has such a feature.

\begin{definition}
  A cycle is any probable sequence of states that starts and ends with the same state.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  A quiet state is a state that has a non-zero probability of emitting an empty sequence.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  A quiet cycle is any cycle having only quiet states.
\end{definition}

\begin{corollary}
  Let $M$ be the number of states of the IMM. If it has no quiet cycles, any sequence of $M$ states
  will have emitted at least one symbol.
\end{corollary}

If IMM has no quiet cycles, there is always a $N \leq L\cdot M$ such that
\begin{align*}
  \mathrm{ML}(\arr{z}) = \sum_{t=1}^{L\cdot M} p(V_{1..t}=\arr{z}, L_t<L).
\end{align*}
